[fan]
pin: PA8
max_power: 1
# If you need to fine-tune the max_power parameter to adapt to your motherboard, first set it to 1.0. Gradually increase the fan speed in the Klipper dashboard until the actual speed no longer increases with the set value. Divide this speed by 100 and enter it into the max_power parameter.
# This parameter defines the maximum power (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) that the pin may be set to. 
# The value 1.0 allows the pin to be set fully enabled for extended periods, while a value of 0.5 would allow the pin to be enabled for no more than half the time. 
# This setting may be used to limit the total power output (over extended periods) to the fan. 
# If this value is less than 1.0, then fan speed requests will be scaled between zero and max_power (for example, if max_power is 0.9 and a fan speed of 80% is requested, then the fan power will be set to 72%).
shutdown_speed: 0
# The desired fan speed (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0) if 
# The microcontroller software enters an error state. 
# The default is 0.
cycle_time: 0.000033
# The amount of time (in seconds) for each PWM power cycle to the fan. 
# The recommended range is 0.000025 ~ 0.00005 seconds, (40Khz ~ 20Khz). 
# The default is 0.000033 seconds (30KHz).
hardware_pwm: False
# Enable this to use hardware PWM instead of software PWM. 
# Most fans do not work well with hardware PWM, so it is not recommended to enable this unless there is an electrical requirement to switch at very high speeds. 
# When using hardware PWM, the actual cycle time is constrained by the implementation and may be significantly different than the requested cycle_time. 
# The default is False.
kick_start_time: 0.100
# Time (in seconds) to run the fan at full speed when either first enabling or increasing it by more than 50% (helps get the fan spinning). 
# The default is 0.100 seconds.
off_below: 0.15
# The blower will not spin with the included brushless driver when the duty cycle is below 15%. When scaled with Max_power at 1, the off_below parameter should be set to 0.15. 
# To calibrate this setting, gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that will reliably drive the fan without stalls. 
# Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 15% -> 0.15/Max_power -> 0.15/1 -> 0.15) or slightly higher. 
# This parameter is the minimum input speed that will power the fan (expressed as a value from 0.0 to 1.0). 
# When a speed lower than off_below is requested, the fan will instead be turned off. 
# This setting may be used to prevent fan stalls and to ensure effective kick starts. 
# To calibrate this setting, start with off_below set to 0.0 and the fan spinning. 
# Gradually lower the fan speed to determine the lowest input speed that will reliably drive the fan without stalls. 
# Set off_below to the duty cycle corresponding to this value (for example, 12% -> 0.12) or slightly higher.
